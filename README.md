# Having-fun-with-C-Erick santos
making multiple classes and header files with c++
In this project we created use a single class to create a rectangular array of characters that can be printed, with and without a frame. 
The array used is a dynamic array which stores an array of character pinters, and each pointer points to one of the lines in the character picture.
The class named Picture included a costume copy constructor, assignment operator overload, and destructor to manage the memeory of the dynamic 
array properly. Also in this class 1D pointers were used to manipulate a 2D array.*/
